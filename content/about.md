#### WHY DID I CREATE THIS SITE?
Because I needed to experiment and evaluate building websites with cloud technology.

#### OK, BUT WHY?
Because I can’t fully focus on emerging cloud technologies in my full time job.

Because I work for a small technology business, and I must fill multiple software engineering roles.

Because small technology businesses believe it is cost prohibitive to solve technical challenges with off the shelf technologies.
